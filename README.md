# Compose Fluent Starter

A modular Compose Multiplatform starter with community [Compose Fluent](https://github.com/compose-fluent/compose-fluent-ui), clean architecture, MVI, and an onboarding → sign-in → dashboard flow.

## Run

Requires JDK 21. Checks require Python 3; web builds require Node.js 22 LTS.
Android builds also require Android SDK 36.

```sh
./gradlew :apps:shared:run                       # Desktop
./gradlew :apps:android:installDevDebug          # Connected Android device
./gradlew :apps:shared:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun # Web
```

Open `apps/ios/FluentStarter.xcodeproj` on macOS for iOS. Select a simulator or configure your signing team for a physical device.

Demo account: **demo@example.com / Demo123!**. The default transport is an in-process Ktor MockEngine; no authentication requests leave the device. Onboarding preferences persist. The demo session is memory-only and sign-in is required after a process restart. Dashboard content is sample data.

Light and dark appearance follow the system theme automatically.

Dependency versions are centralized in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Internal dependencies use type-safe accessors such as `implementation(projects.core.common)`. Koin annotations generate registrations during normal Gradle builds.

See [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [development](docs/development.md), and [validation](docs/validation.md).
See [local storage](docs/storage.md) and [build environments](docs/environments.md) for platform setup.

## Check and build

```sh
./gradlew :check
./gradlew :apps:android:assembleDevDebug
./gradlew :apps:shared:wasmJsBrowserDistribution
./gradlew :apps:shared:packageDistributionForCurrentOS
```

Use `xvfb-run -a ./gradlew :check` on headless Linux. Native installers require the corresponding operating system. Apple builds require Xcode.

Compose Fluent remains experimental. Its API and accessibility coverage require evaluation for each target. Production authentication, secure token storage, refresh tokens, and OAuth are integration work; this starter does not simulate them as production security.
