# Compose Fluent Starter

A modular Compose Multiplatform starter with community [Compose Fluent](https://github.com/compose-fluent/compose-fluent-ui), clean architecture, MVI, and an onboarding → sign-in → dashboard flow.

## Run

Requires JDK 21. Checks require Python 3; web builds require Node.js 22 LTS.
Android builds also require Android SDK 36.

```sh
./gradlew :apps:shared:run                       # Desktop
./gradlew :apps:android:installDevDebug          # Connected Android device
./gradlew :apps:shared:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun # Web
```

Open `apps/ios/FluentStarter.xcodeproj` on macOS for iOS. Select a simulator or configure your signing team for a physical device.

Demo account: **demo@example.com / Demo123!**. The default transport is an in-process Ktor MockEngine; no authentication requests leave the device. Onboarding preferences persist. Sessions restore from secure storage on mobile/desktop; Web sessions remain in memory. Dashboard content is sample data, cached locally. Saved activities use a transactional outbox and persist with the active session.

Light and dark appearance follow the system theme automatically.

Dependency versions are centralized in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Internal dependencies use type-safe accessors such as `implementation(projects.core.common)`. Koin annotations generate registrations during normal Gradle builds.

## Check and build

```sh
./gradlew :check
./gradlew :apps:android:assembleDevDebug
./gradlew :apps:shared:wasmJsBrowserDistribution
./gradlew :apps:shared:packageDistributionForCurrentOS
```

Use `xvfb-run -a ./gradlew :check` on headless Linux. Native installers require the corresponding operating system. Apple builds require Xcode.

Compose Fluent remains experimental. Its API and accessibility coverage require evaluation for each target. The session and refresh foundations require a real backend contract for production use; the included transport and tokens are demo fixtures. OAuth remains backend integration work.
